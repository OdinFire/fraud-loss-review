A compact set of four SQL queries used to scope, attribute, segment, and review fraud-related loss over a defined time window. These queries pull loss events into a unified view, tag them with basic fraud/non-fraud attribution, break the loss into meaningful segments (seller, geo, payment, device, cohort), and surface any entities that appear recoverable through follow-up investigation and control refinements. The goal is speed: a lightweight, repeatable workflow that answers the core questions of “how much was lost,” “why,” “where it concentrated,” and “what portion can realistically be recouped.”
